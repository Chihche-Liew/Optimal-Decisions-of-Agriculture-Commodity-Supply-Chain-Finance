Agriculture plays a critical role in the economies of many developing coun-tries, with small farmers comprising a significant portion of the sector. However.these farmers often face challenges in accessing capital resources for inputs suchas seeds, fertilizers, and machinery, leading to instability in the supply chainand financial risk for small farmers. The nature of agricultural products, whichare often bulk commodities and subject to price fluctuations and climate disasters, also makes production and fnancing decisions difficult. Additionally.contract farming and insurance have been utilized to transfer risk to purchas-ing companies and insurance providers, respectively. Purchase order financinghas also been suggested as a solution for small farmers to secure credit andexpand production. In this paper, we propose a supply chain model frameworkto understand the decentralized decision-making process between small farm-ers and purchasing companies in one-to-one supply chains, using a Stackelberggame model. We analyze this process through the basic newsvendor model, thenewsvendor model with financing, and the newsvendor model with insurance,and give the optimal decision of farmer and purchasing company.
